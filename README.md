## General info
‚ö†Ô∏è  This project is still under development, improvements soon!    
This project is a simple app created by the team Galatine to gain more knowledge about Swift-SwiftUI Programming.              

The user gets to pick ingredients from the list presented in the "Pantry" section of the app. 
      
By pressing the button "Get Recipes" a list of recipes will be shown and the user can choose which one to replicate.                

In the "Community" section the user can post about the experience and recreation of the recipes, and also react to other users' posts.      

In the "Profile" section the user can handle, change, and delete informations about their profile, personal informations and can access other sections to customise the experience on the app.
    
üîú Future implementations:
